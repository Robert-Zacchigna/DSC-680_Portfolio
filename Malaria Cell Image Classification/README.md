## How to Use

### 1. Download Extract Dataset

Download Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/iarunava/cell-images-for-detecting-malaria
> The dataset for this project was too big to be stored on GitHub, thus you will need to download it yourself.

Click the "Download" button just underneath the right side of the page header (top of the page).

Extract and move the dataset files into the "Cell_Images" folder.

### 2. Run Notebook Cells

The dataset and all dependencies are included in this folder, trust the notebook 
and then run each cell (in order) in the notebook to conduct the analysis.
