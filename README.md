1. <ins>Predict Graduation Rates (2019 College Data)</ins>
   * This project explores how various university factors (Economic, Academic, Enrollment, Faculty, etc...) can predict a university's student graduation rate. 
   * [GitHub README]()


2. <ins>Public and Private Graduation Rates Analysis (2019 College Data)</ins>
   * This project explores the relationship between public and private universities graduation rates to see if a university being Private or Public has an effect on its graduation rate and what factors specifically affect those rates. 
   * [GitHub README]()


3. <ins>Air Pollution Analysis and Data Scraping of Seoul (Districts), South Korea</ins>
   * This is a 4 part Jupyter notebook that scrapes Seoul, South Korean Air Pollution data and then parses/reformat it into a more usable format. The different data sources that the data is retrieved from is then all condensed into one large dataset and some preliminary EDA is conducted on the data to show the overall makeup of the data points. 
   * [GitHub README]()


4. <ins>Predict Prospective Student Graduate Admission into University</ins>
   * This projects attempts to predict the chance of a prospective student being admitted into a university's graduate program, along with exploring multiple different prediction model types to find the best one possible.
   * [GitHub README]()


5. <ins>Neural Network Classifiers</ins>
   * This python notebook outlines different ways of setting up and training Neural Network Classifiers with Scikit and Keras. The networks are trained using a collection of categorized online comment and image datasets.
