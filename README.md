### Jupyter Notebook [nbextensions](https://jupyter-contrib-nbextensions.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)

> While not necessary to run the notebooks, I thought I would add the list of notebook extensions I have enabled 
> as I find them quite useful, and you might find them useful as well.

## Project List

> <ins>**NOTES**</ins>
> * GitHub might not render Jupyter Notebooks correctly (or at all), thus internal linking and graphs might not work as desired
>   * You can click the [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/faq#what-is-nbviewer) link listed in the README files to 
> view the properly rendered Jupyter Notebook, *however*, you will **not** be able to run cells in the notebook
>   * If you want to be able to interact with and run cells in the notebooks stored in this repo without setting up your 
> own Jupyter environment, you can instead click the "**Launch Binder**" button in the README header to launch a JupyterHub of this repo fully in your browser.

1. [<ins>Air Pollution Analysis and Data Scraping of Seoul (Districts), South Korea</ins>](https://github.com/Robert-Zacchigna/Portfolio/tree/main/Air%20Pollution%20Analysis%20and%20Data%20Scraping%20of%20Seoul%20(Districts)%2C%20South%20Korea)
   * This is a 4 part Jupyter notebook that scrapes Seoul, South Korean Air Pollution data and then parses/reformat it 
   into a more usable format. The different data sources are then all condensed into one large dataset using sqlite3 to 
   create a tiny database to query the data from and create visualizations.
   * [README](https://github.com/Robert-Zacchigna/Portfolio/blob/main/Air%20Pollution%20Analysis%20and%20Data%20Scraping%20of%20Seoul%20(Districts)%2C%20South%20Korea/README.md)
