1. [<ins>Air Pollution Analysis and Data Scraping of Seoul (Districts), South Korea</ins>](https://github.com/Robert-Zacchigna/DSC-680_Portfolio/tree/main/Air%20Pollution%20Analysis%20and%20Data%20Scraping%20of%20Seoul%20(Districts)%2C%20South%20Korea)
   * This is a 4 part Jupyter notebook that scrapes Seoul, South Korean Air Pollution data and then parses/reformat it into a more usable format. The different data sources that the data is retrieved from is then all condensed into one large dataset and some preliminary EDA is conducted on the data to show the overall makeup of the data points.
   * [GitHub README](https://github.com/Robert-Zacchigna/DSC-680_Portfolio/blob/main/Air%20Pollution%20Analysis%20and%20Data%20Scraping%20of%20Seoul%20(Districts)%2C%20South%20Korea/README.md)
