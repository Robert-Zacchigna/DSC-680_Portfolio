## How to Use

### 1. Extract Dataset

First go into the Air_Data folder and extract the dataset from the zip file inside.

### 2. Follow Notebook Order
This project contains a series of 4 Jupyter notebooks that can be run individually in the 
order specified to reproduce their cell results. The dataset and all dependencies are 
included in this folder, trust the notebook and then run each cell (in order) in the notebook to conduct the analysis.


## Requirements

### Jupyter Environment

You will need to set up a Jupyter environment in order to run the notebooks:

* [JupyterLab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/installation.html#pip)
* [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install/notebook-classic.html#alternative-for-experienced-python-users-installing-jupyter-with-pip)
    * [Running the Notebook](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/running.html#running)

### Air Quality API

The [3rd jupyter notebook](https://github.com/Robert-Zacchigna/Portfolio/blob/main/Air%20Pollution%20Analysis%20and%20Data%20Scraping%20of%20Seoul%20(Districts)%2C%20South%20Korea/Part%203%20-%20Parse%20and%20Reformat%20South%20Korean%20Air%20Pollution%20Data%20(API).ipynb) 
has an Air Quality API requirement from: https://aqicn.org/json-api/doc/

You must create an API token and follow the steps in the notebook in order to properly use the API
